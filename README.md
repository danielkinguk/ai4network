Applicability of AI in the Network

The AI4NET side meeting explores the multifaceted impact of AI in networks. Traditionally characterized by complex, monolithic infrastructures, networks are transitioning into agile, intelligent ecosystems. AI-driven technologies are becoming the linchpin for this transformation, offering unprecedented opportunities for enhancing network performance, optimizing resource allocation, ensuring security, and delivering superior user experiences.

-	Network performance optimization: AI can analyze network traffic patterns and identify areas where performance can be improved. This can be done by optimizing routing tables, adjusting bandwidth allocation, and identifying and resolving bottlenecks;
-	Network security: AI can detect and mitigate cyber threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. AI can also be used to identify and protect vulnerable systems and devices;
-	Network automation: AI can be used to automate many of the tasks involved in managing and operating networks, such as provisioning new devices, configuring network settings, and responding to incidents. This can help to reduce costs and improve efficiency;
-	Network planning and forecasting: AI can analyze network data and trends to forecast future demand and plan for capacity upgrades. This can help to ensure that networks can meet users' needs without experiencing performance problems.

Overall, AI is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance, security, and efficiency of network resources and operations. As AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective ways to use AI to benefit the development of the Internet.

We invite interested people to the side meeting to discuss requirements, use cases, and AI solutions to improve the network. Anyone is welcome to share their thoughts, including but not limited to, research work such as papers, demos, trial deployments, commercial implementation and existing deployments.

### Agenda: 

#### 1. Data, AI and Cybersecurity - a possible cocktail?**
Presenter: Professor Marco, POLITO
     
Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence technologies, led by Deep Learning, have gained unprecedented momentum over the past decade. Following this wave of ``AI summer", the network research community has also embraced AI/ML algorithms to address many problems     related to network operations, management and cybersecurity. In this talk Iâ€™ll present some of our recent results in applying AI-based solution to automatically process traffic traces and detect novel attacks, prevent cybersquatting attacks, support forensic    investigations, and open new opportunities to protect users from possible abuses.

#### 3. AI4ME: Network Challenges and Role of AI in Personalised Object Media at Scale**
Presenter: Rajiv Ramdhany, Senior R&D Engineer and Scientist, BBC
     
Abstract: The AI4NME project is building an infrastructure of object media experiences (personalised media) using edge computing resources to render customised real-time content to high-end audience devices. The project addresses the challenges of generating and      delivering tailored object media by intelligently distributing the processing and data through the delivery network, making optimal use of AI-based resources in the cloud, and utilising edge-compute nodes to provide personalised media experiences to audiences     across the globe.
