### Agenda: 

Introduction and intent. 
Time: 13:30 to 13:05

#### 1. Gen-AI Multi-Agent based troubleshooting of multi-layer IP over DWDM Networks
Time 13:35 to 13:55
Presenter: Reza Rokui (Ciena)

Abstract: Due to the complexity of multi-layer IP over DWDM networks, advanced troubleshooting 
methodologies are essential to ensure optimal performance and reliability. This talk explores the 
application of Generative AI (Gen-AI) and multi-agent LLM systems in diagnosing and resolving issues 
within these networks. By leveraging the capabilities of Gen-AI, we can automate the detection, 
analysis, and resolution of network issues, thereby reducing downtime and enhancing operational 
efficiency. Multi-agent systems facilitate collaborative problem-solving, where autonomous agents 
interact and share insights to pinpoint and address faults across both IP and optical layers.

#### 2. AI for Autonomous Networking
Time 13:55 to 14:15
Presenter: Javier & Daniele Ceccarelli (Cisco)

Abstract: To be provided.

Relevant IETF Internet-Drafts: To be provided.
Slides: To be provided.

#### 3. AIOps as a step towards closed loop
Time 14:15 to 14:35
Presenter: Vincenzo Riccobene (Huawei)

Abstract: Nowadays, detecting and solving network incidents requires operators to invest a significant 
amount of time and effort monitoring and analyzing networks. In this presentation we investigate how 
AIOps can help them introducing automation and reducing Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Identify (MTTI) 
incidents and their root causes, leading towards a faster incident resolution and providing a building 
block for automated closed loop.

Slides: To be provided.

#### 4. A Story of Semantics and Data Infrastructures
Time 14:35 to 14:45
Presenter: Ignacio Dominguez Martinez-Casaneuva

#### 5. Open Discussion a) Utilising AI in Network Operations b) How can machine learning improve network operations? c) What work might there be for the IETF?
Time:  14:45 - 15:00 
Presenter: Daniel King (Lancaster University) and Weiqiang Cheng (chengweiqiang@chinamobile.com)
