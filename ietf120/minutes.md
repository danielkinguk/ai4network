Meeting Overview:
The AI4NET side meeting at IETF 120 focused on discussing the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into network management and security. The session was chaired by Daniel King and Cheng Li, featuring presentations
from various experts on the challenges, frameworks, and applications of AI in networking.

Key Topics Discussed:

Research Challenges in AI and Network Management:
Jerome François highlighted the need for a centralized repository (wiki) to track AI/ML work relevant to IETF, metadata creation for training datasets, and the importance of identifying datasets used in IETF-related
technologies.

Network Anomaly Detection Framework:
Thomas Graf presented a framework using unsupervised machine learning and symbolic AI for detecting network anomalies, noting a successful proof-of-concept in production for 18 months. Discussions centered on the
distinction between this framework and traditional incident management systems.

Intent-Based Cloud Security System (ICSS):
Paul (Jaehoon) Jeong introduced a new YANG Model-driven, closed-loop solution for cloud security. The discussion questioned the novelty and AI components of the solution, with Jeong explaining the integration of AI/ML for
data processing.

Leveraging Large Language Models for Network Security:
Juan Deng presented a framework to enhance network security using large language models, sparking a discussion on potential IETF contributions to support this work.

AI in Transport Networks:
Oscar Dios Gonzalez discussed the benefits and use cases of AI in managing transport networks, emphasizing optimization and efficiency improvements.
Open Discussion:

The session concluded with a broader discussion on the potential of AI in network operations, including specific use cases and frameworks for AI applications in central network functions like congestion control.
Key Takeaways:

AI and Security: Security is a crucial area for AI application in networking, but challenges remain, including the need for high-quality datasets.

IETF's Role: The meeting aimed to identify how IETF could support the integration of AI into networking, addressing gaps and facilitating new developments. Creation of a Wiki to document and track relevant IETF activity
such as Working Groups, Internet-Drafts and Workshops. 

Current and Future Standards Work: The presentations showcased ongoing efforts to incorporate AI into network management and security, with a call for more research and practical frameworks.

How can the IETF assist in the development of AI-based technologies in relation to IETF-based technologies: Investigate a respoistry and "how-to" for training data sets related to IETF work. There is also an industry need
for metadata to describe each data set and data model and/or schema. 

Overall, the meeting highlighted the growing importance of AI in networking, with a focus on security, optimization, and the need for collaboration and standardization through the IETF.
