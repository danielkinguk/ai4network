### Agenda: 

Introduction and intent. 
Time: 13:00 to 13:05

#### 1. Research Challenges in Coupling Artificial Intelligence and Network Management
Time 13:05 to 13:30
Presenter: Jerome  François - University of Luxembourg and Inria 

Abstract: AI was discussed for years in NMRG with technical workshops but also with a recent document on AI challenges (draft-irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges). This talk will review this document and recent discussions of the group that would potentially shape future work items of the research agenda of NMRG. Besides, considerations regarding the potential use of GenAI will be discussed in particular regarding security and robustness of models.

#### 2. An Architecture for a Network Anomaly Detection Framework
Time: 13:30 to 13:55
Presenter: Thomas Graf – Swisscom (Schweiz) AG

Abstract: Addressing the need to detect connectivity service interruption faster than humans can and facilitate collaboration by enabling exchange on labeled data with standardized semantics on a common framework.

#### 3. ICSS: Intent-Based Cloud Security System with Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF
Time: 13:55 to 14:20
Presenter: Paul (Jaehoon) Jeong - SKKU

Abstract: This talk introduces an Intent-Based Cloud Security System (ICSS) with Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) that is the IETF standard framework and interfaces. This ICSS can support the translation of a security user's declarative intent on a required security service into a detailed imperative policy for Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the form of Virtual Network Function (VNF) or Cloud-Native Network Function (CNF). It can also support closed-loop security services through the collection and analysis of monitoring data from NSFs. Thus, the ICSS can provide flexible and efficient security services to the customers in cloud-based network environments such as 5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The design and implementation of the ICSS is based on the framework and data models of the IETF I2NSF. Its architecture is an enhanced version of the I2NSF framework for Intent-Based Networking (IBN) for intelligent security services. Through experiments, it is shown that the proposed ICSS can cope with various security attacks autonomously and efficiently in the manner of intent-based security management.

#### 4. Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Network Security: A Framework
Time: 14:20 to 14:45
Presentor: Juan Deng

Abstract: This presentation introduces an architectural framework that applies large language models to network security. The architectural framework considers the capabilities that large language models can bring to network security and the requirements of applying large language models. The framework consists of crafted modules with distinct functionalities and their interactions to leverage the power of large language models to network security.

#### 5. The role of AI in the control and management of Transport Networks
Time: 14:45 - 15:10
Presenter: Oscar Dios Gonzalez - Telefonica

Abstract: The increasing complexity of network layers and services, coupled with higher traffic dynamism and a reduction in operational resources, drives the need for network automation. Artificial intelligence (AI), integrated with a data-driven network management approach and real-time streaming telemetry, will enable a shift away from human-dependent operations, paving the way for autonomous networks. In this talk, we will explore the role of AI in the transition from manual to fully automated networks.

#### #6. Open Discussion a) Utilising AI in Network Operations b) How can machine learning improve network operations? c) What work might there be for the IETF?
Time:  15:10 - 15:30
